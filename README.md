VIA theme for ZSH
=================


This is a theme for ZSH which mainly forks the historical theme used on
[VIA Centrale RÃ©seaux](https://via.ecp.fr/) servers. It can be used with
ZSH frameworks such as [Oh-My-ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).


Usage
-----

### Install for Oh-My-ZSH

In order to use this theme, you have to clone this repository in your Oh-My-ZSH
`custom/themes` directory ( usually `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes` ) :

```
git clone https://github.com/badouralix/oh-my-via.git $ZSH/custom/themes/oh-my-via
```

You then need to select this theme in your `~/.zshrc` :

```
ZSH_THEME="oh-my-via/via"
```

### Customization

`OHMYVIA_TIME_FORMAT` in your `~/.zshrc`.
